							<h3>Alex Chase</h3>
							<p>Alex Chase was evidently born at a young age (who knew??) and raised by wolves until he finally made the realization that fighting for scraps of meat amongst wolf pups was not only not the right life path for him, but was in fact gen-ed credit in high school terms! Alex graduated from high school with honors and proceeded to go to the University of Rochester, just like the rest of us.</p>

					<h3>Jennifer Ngene</h3>
						<p>Jennifer Ngene was born in The Gambia in 1999 and was raised between there and Nigeria for the first few years of life. In 2005, her family immigrated to Minnesota, and eventually to somewhere else (undisclosed) in order to provide a better life for Jennifer and her little brother, for which she is very grateful.</p>

					<h3>Maria Mancheno</h3>
						<p>Maria Mancheno is from Quito, Equador, and is 21 years of age. She was born and raised in Quito, as well as attended school there in the "American School of Quito", where she acquired an interest in the natural sciences. She attributes this to her preparedness for the rigor that the University of Rochester has to offer.</p>
