##Domain

The subject matter aligning the three people is that all three people are DMS majors, the people in question being Alex Chase, Jennifer Ngene, adn Maria Mancheno.

##Ontology

**The people in question will be refered to as "The DMS Majors", or simply DMS Majors for the sake of simplicity**

* DMS majors all discussed their life before college
* DMS majors all discussed their interests
* DMS majors all discussed why they were a DMS major in the first place

##Taxonomy

**Instead of making a list it makes more sense to me to just discuss the taxonomy in paragraph form**

For each category: life before college, interests, and why they chose their major, I listed each of the DMS majors and wrote a brief summary of the information in their section.

##Coreography

The order is based off of something that was discussed by each of the DMS majors, and pertains greatly to why it is that they are a DMS major today
