					<h3>Alex Chase</h3>
						<p>Alex makes the claim that it is due to his bountiful "drive to create", as well as the drive to solve the world's up and coming problems. Furthermore, whatever Alex winds up doing with the rest of his life, he hopes that it's something that he at the very least enjoys doing, and my be considered "neat".</p>

					<h3>Jennifer Ngene</h3>
						<p>Jennifer saw the light in terms of web design, and from there realized the potential that dms could have for her creativity. Furthermore, it can be used as an outlet for her skills and a way for her to learn more about the field.</p>

					<h3>Maria Mancheno</h3>
					<p>Maria's appeal to DMS came through her interest in website design, as it seemed to be a potential avenue for jobs in the future. Where mathematics was something that made more sense to her, it was not necessarily something that she wished to pursue as a career in the future, thus she leaned more towards DMS as a major, and Mathematics as a minor.</p>
